## Narrative Snapshot
Rahul (32, Bengaluru software engineer) is perpetually late at gift-shopping. After one heated anniversary quarrel he signs up during Flipkart’s Big Billion Days, links UPI AutoPay, and sets a default ₹2,500 budget. From then on he only interacts via occasional WhatsApp thumbs-up emojis while gifts for birthdays, Karwa Chauth, and anniversary land exactly when needed.
