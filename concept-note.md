# Concept Note

## Problem Statement
Forgetful husbands often miss key gifting occasions such as anniversaries and birthdays, leading to disappointment and relationship stress.

## Solution Approach
A done-for-you gifting service where the husband enters important dates once and selects a "lazy mode" option. The system then automatically picks, orders, and delivers perfect gifts on special occasions, requiring zero ongoing effort.

## Success Metrics
- Number of user sign-ups
- Gift delivery success rate
- User satisfaction ratings and feedback
