# Lazy Mode Selection Flow

1. User chooses between two lazy modes:
   - **You Decide Everything**: AI selects gifts based on a 5-question quiz or guesses from age + city.
   - **Ill Choose Once**: User selects a broad gift theme (e.g., jewelry, books, experiences).
2. The app saves mode selection for future automated gifting.
