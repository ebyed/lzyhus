# Features Catalogue & MVP Waterline
_Last updated: 2025-07-20_

This catalogue provides a **single source of truth** for all major capabilities planned for the **Lazy Husband Gifting App**, clearly distinguishing what makes the initial go-to-market (MVP) and what is deferred to future releases.

## Reading the Waterline
• **✅ MVP** – Must exist for day-1 launch.  
• **🌊 Stretch** – Nice-to-have enhancements that can ship right after MVP if capacity allows.  
• **🚀 Future** – Longer-term bets (≥6 months out).
